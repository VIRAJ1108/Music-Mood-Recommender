This project, Music Recommender for Mood, is a machine learning–based system that suggests songs based on the user’s mood and current activity. It uses a dataset of songs containing audio features such as energy, valence, danceability, tempo, and acousticness. These features are preprocessed using pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, then clustered into mood groups using the K-Means algorithm. Each mood cluster is labeled (for example, Happy / Energetic or Sad / Calm) based on the average energy and valence values. The system then adjusts recommendations dynamically through context-based feature weighting depending on user activity, such as Workout, Studying, or Relaxing. Finally, recommendations are generated by calculating the cosine similarity between the user’s context-adjusted feature profile and the available songs.
The project’s backend is implemented in Python, while the interactive user interface is built using Streamlit. Scikit-learn handles feature scaling and similarity computation. This structure makes the system modular, explainable, and extendable for real-world applications, such as integration with the Spotify API for live music data.
